## Property-Management-Rails

This is originally a React app that I'm building in Rails. It is a sample product for a management app
that will be used for apartment building news and any repair requests.

The App Contains:

- Newsletters that contain general information for the residents, and any announcments.
- Archive of old newsletters
- Repair or inspection request form so that tenants can request specific actions from the management.
- More to be added....
